Discovery Process

- Discovery Meetings: Taking Complex Ideas and Distilling them into a Plan
- Product lifecycle: Discovery, information architecture (prototype), design & development
- Discovery meeting: 1-5 days, proposal is the deliverable, not committed to hire us for the following phases
  - Ten steps to success
    - Humanize the relationship
      - Ice breaker to get people comfortable
    - Client pitch
      - Have client explain what they want you to do- a list of features/functions
      - Show similar competitor products and how they want to make it better or different
    - Identify assumptions
      - Have client sketch the product and pitch it to each other to come up with a centralized layout
      - Client must receive information on the slant to truly understand
      - pay attention to who's comfortable and who isn't - who's the key stakeholder - what they're focused on drawing
    - Identify the core experience
      - Drill down to core functions of application
        - what is everything made of
      - e.g: flashcard app => deck => cards => two sides: term & definition => text and/or media
      - Could be a flow chart
    - Identify user types & success actions
      - focused on user experience
      - what action would each user take to see product as a success
    - Identify every step a user needs to complete success actions
      - Top down is best and keep it simple/basic
      - you can add more details as you expand
      - Identify each action that can be taken
    - Start building your sitemap
      - Take steps 5 and 6 and break them down and determine every single unique view that exists
      - List out possible successive actions and identify whats necessary or isn't
      - Looks more complex than previous steps
      - can be conveyed easily to client
    - Pitch sitemap
      - explain to the client how user will navigate the site
      - there will be lots of feedback and questions so remain open to it
      - Hopefully you end up with something mutually agreed upon thats solid
      - Walk through the flow with client- dialogue is very important
    - Rough wireframe for each view
      - wire out each view on the final sitemap
      - doesn't have to be pretty- this isn't the prototype
      - Should include data objects that will be there and rough sketch/mockup
      - app to manage something like this could be Trello
        - each view is its own list
      - end product should be a comprehensive feature list for the product
      - this should give you enough to create an estimate for the project
      - Could be achieved from an RFP (request for proposal) also but this is mutually agreed upon
    - Drink & Eat
      - furthers humanization of the relationship between you and the client and reinforces collaboration
      - Establishing a healthy working relationship is very important
  - Discovery Meeting Deliverables
    - discover summary
      - includes photos and assets
      - a narrative of the entire meeting
    - implementations plan
      - includes cost estimation and estimate of how long it will take
    - Put them together ASAP
  - Get all the right stakeholders, but no more than necessary
  - Stay humble
