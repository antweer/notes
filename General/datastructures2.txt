Data Structures - Stacks and Queues

- Particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently
- usually pretty abstract and low level, unlike OOP classes
- Arrays
  - collection of elements of the same type typically
  - stored contiguously in memory typically
  - accessed via index or offset
  - native support in most modern languages
- Stack
  - models a collection of objects
  - displays last in first out (LIFO) behavior
  - push, pop(last), peek (get val of next element without removing it)
  - stacks are commonly used to model navigation
- Queue
  - data structure that models a colelction of objects
  - First in first out behavior  (FIFO)
  - push, pop(first), peek (get val of first element without removing)
  - message queues- the firs message received should be the first message displayed to the user
  - buffers- first piece of data placed in the bugger should be first piece written to disk
- FIFO vs LIFO
- understand push, pop, peek
- be able to implement stacks or queues in pseudo-code or JS/python
