Request-Response protocol in the client-server computing model. Every request made by the client returns a response by the server with a status code describing the completion status information of the request. A web browser is an example of a user agent (UA). UA is whatever is accessing, consuming, or displaying web content (i.e. crawlelrs, mobile apps, or other software that requires the internet).

They are official documents of internet specifications, communications protocols, procedures, and events. Process is documented in RFC 2026. Three Sub Series: Best Current Practice (BPC), For Your Information (FYI - Now Concluded), and Standard (STD). Status of RFCs is one of the follow: Informational, Experimental, Best Current Practice, Standards Track, or Historic. Each RFC is static - if changes need to be made, they're published as a new RFC that supercedes the previous one. RFC Editor (https://www.rfc-editor.org/retrieve/) is the official source of RFCs.
